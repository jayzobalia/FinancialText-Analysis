Banking financial institutions churning data generate accurate information visitor efficiently display customized content visitors products interested displayed home page . This prompts visitor click display link understand product buy . You display content altogether confuse visitor log making deal leaving information contacted . The information digital footprints customized extent rate visitor convert Customized content displayed based current visitors show characteristics visitors past converted . Since conversion rate minimal millions visitors bank website buy product service online powerful machine learning algorithms catch pattern limited amount data learn . Also huge amount data read algorithm digital footprints generated . Machine Learning algorithms Random Forest Bagging methodology Gradient Boosting Boosting methodology rescue . These algorithms efficient handling huge amount data identify patterns good accuracy . Data Scientists technique called Stacking outputs algorithms combined fed model calculate probability combination machine learning algorithms . So time visit bank website pop up displays offering attractive interest rate home loan assured heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running background monitored activity website . Clustering stop shop analytics solutions Majority decision making Banks Financial Institutions dividing things groups similar characteristics behave decisions applied batches saves time energy money . Clustering algorithms rescue count number times proposed clusters solution business problem share instances distinctly remember . The bank wanted identify loyal customers loyal . Our approach define loyalty based metrics recency transactions frequency transactions monetary transactions RFM model analytics world . These metrics combined weight assigned based important business enable rank customers interacting compared eventually dormant fall loyal category . An important consideration study transactions depth errors creep . For instance interesting developed categories based RFM score single savings account holder scored high recency . This intriguing spent days identifying happening realize savings account interest receivable account holder credits account end month . The trade offs technical suppose . The instance business wanted identify bank branches lower average performance metrics customers acquired average balances maintained accounts quality home loan applications head branch approval promoter score customers employee attrition . Using k means clustering identified differentiated high performing branches metrics lower . This helped bank taking decisions reviewing financial targets lower performing branches provide focus employee training incentivize high performing branches inspire .
