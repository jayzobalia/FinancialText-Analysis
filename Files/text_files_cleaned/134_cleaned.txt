The democratization data access usage enterprise underway . Establishing data governance organization wide information management . Metadata management end to end traceability data sourcing data consumption . This traceability required personal data regulations GDPR . Traceability Traceability means transparency flows goods data basic requirement modern supply chain . Consumers authorities quality assurance product standards demand transparent information raw materials primary packaging . Brand owners fully answer questions quickly batch level source raw materials production methods staging points . With good traceability information system brand owner guarantee protection consumers . It quickly problems provide adequate information builds confidence consumers authorities . Solution We choose MUML underlying software design method due existing support real time due preliminary work approach cf . Sect . . Furthermore rely consensus specification requirements due tight integration MUML . More precisely provide partial solutions traceability problem information flow requirements Specification illegitimate information flow level consensus system models . To address challenge C provide systems engineers specification technique information flow requirements allowing mark flow elements system environment illegitimate . The specification place form enables comparison actual information flow detected verification . Thus distinguishing illegitimate legitimate flow judge information flow requirements violated . Deriving verifiable information flow properties requirements automatic fashion . As contribution challenge C derived properties relate initial requirements MUML software design model verify model compliance . In order produce meaningful verification results derived properties preserve semantics initial requirements derivation interrelate consensus system model MUML software design model . It beneficial infer relation models automatically traces model transformation . Real time verification non interference properties basis software design models . In order overcome challenge i.e. decide MUML model fulfills derived information flow properties rigorous verification non interference carried . To end enrich theoretical basis real time non interference ready to use verification technique . To cope infinite real valued state space explicitly applicability existing verification techniques area real time model checking . Reinterpretation verification results trace back initial requirements contribution challenge C . Depending complexity interrelations MUML software design Conses system model verification results obtained significance engineers draw conclusions initial information flow requirements . Therefore order give significance results automatically relate back requirements initially . Every requirement marked met non occurrence information flow proved verification violation verification detected occurrence illegitimate flow . Previous studies shown software traceability ability link related artifacts sources project e.g. source code cases documentation . improves project outcomes assisting developers stakeholders common tasks impact analysis concept location . Establishing traceability links software system important costly task half struggle . As project undergoes maintenance evolution artifacts added existing changed resulting outdated traceability information . Therefore specific steps make traceability links maintained tandem rest project . In article address problem propose approach called TRAIL maintaining traceability information system . Advantages benefits full traceability Traceability open supply chain company achieving Increase customer satisfaction safety In event recall place manufacturers minimize impact recalling items specific serial numbers built faulty component material process significantly reducing expenses customer impact . Meet government compliance mandates Ease burden lessen chances fines penalties noncompliance . Improve data accuracy Reduce human error . Save millions lost revenue recall costs damage control campaigns litigation fines . Mobile track and trace solutions prevent quality issues occur event product recall manufacturers act swiftly narrow scope recall reduce exposure negative brand impressions damage revenues . Reduce warranty claim costs Traceability enables manufacturers accurately analyze root product part failure recover warranty costs liable suppliers . With automation traceability solutions discrete manufacturers track warranty part information up sell cross sell complementary products services . In addition labor hours reallocated focus revenue generating activities versus double reporting occurs data collected manually transferred computer system . For purpose traceability system identifies objects representation format serial numbers lot numbers transfer medium labels RF tags . When people related supply chain including consumers recognize status product objects information linked tracing forward back easily . This ensures quality safety product . We work reducing verification problem refinement check real time systems . After preparing verification backend plan address requirements specification level model based systems engineering derivation verifiable properties year . Finally intend carry final integration systems engineering software design order establish desired traceability solution . Our evaluation strategy enables carry stepwise incremental validation contributions .
