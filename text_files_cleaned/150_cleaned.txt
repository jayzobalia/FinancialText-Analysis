Since quarter oil prices plummeted barrel barrel . Currently oil price hovering barrel . Events force O G companies restructure upstream midstream downstream operations . Refinery shutdowns handling grades crude oil changing environmental regulations pushing gross refining margins bare minimum . With IoT refineries plan shutdowns minimize downtime improve safety record . In fact refineries incorporated IoT operations Smart Refineries . IoT step evolution oil gas industry . It play significant role lower operating expenses increase reliability complete production plant . O G companies world focussing IoT increase efficiency decrease non productive time costs . Basically IoT covers entire chain Oil Gas industry pinpointing location exploration oil wells refining crude oil transportation oil pipelines trucks . From trillions dollars spent year exploration production E P small investment IoT reap huge benefits entire chain petroleum operations . Preventative Maintenance PM The O G industry loses billions dollars year due non productive time NPT . IoT reduce NPT events real time data predict breakdowns schedule preventative maintenance . This huge field application IoT . Preventive maintenance PM continuously monitoring parameters equipment vibration temperature oil levels parameters critical operation equipment sensors . The sensors continuously relay real time data receiver . Due management accurately determine maintenance time spent repairing machine broken greater losses organization face due production losses completely eliminated . In O G sector PM pumps compressors heat exchangers steam traps relief valves equipment instrumentation expensive difficult failure lead high monetary losses . Billions dollars savings achieved industries incorporated IoT plants PM . The Petropiar refinery Chevron PDVSA joint venture Mejorador Jose Barcelona Venezuela installed predictive management software conjunction field instruments . Using technologies enabled refinery increase production reduce costs improve profitability . Smart Pipelines Pipelines form transportation backbone O G industry . For refinery pipeline networks scale thousands kilometers rugged lands mountains caring black gold . maintenance supervision pipelines terms theft leaks corrosion important huge network wired technology . A pipeline leak oil leak high flow rate due high pressure differential created leak detection plays critical role . IoT supervisory control data acquisition SCADA plays immensely important role . Represented Schneider Electric Cisco Smart Connected Pipeline . It open end to end solution pipeline management future ready communication architectures integrated automated pipeline operations modern technologies . IoT enabled companies save millions dollars oil losses due pipeline leaks theft . Asset Management increase operational efficiency A typical petrochemical industry millions equipment large small asset intensive industry . The assets range Pressure Relief Valves PRVs Heat Exchangers huge Distillation Columns DC . Identifying efficient working larger equipment easy important parameters temperature pressure flow level wired DCS . It failure smaller equipment unnoticed period time leads operational inefficiency . When smaller equipment fitted sensors transformed thing send data cloud system real time analysis complete operation quickly identify issue . A classic asset management critical non instrumented part Emerson Process Management successful implementation IoT Denka Singapore Pte Ltd. subsidiary Denka chemical company world largest facilities continuous polymerizationSteam important heating utility Denka . As steam travels pipes condensing exchanging heat concerned process fluid condensate . This non condensable gases removed steam traps . An incorrectly operating steam trap results lower heating efficiency escape live steam industry studies showing steam trap failure rate region year Denka hundreds thousands steam traps typical facility cost consequences failure significant . Denka approach correction steam traps process facilities manual checking contractor annual basis . This caused large amount steam waste created financial energy loss . To automate laborious process steam trap monitoring provide frequent updates health steam traps Denka plant Emerson Process Managementarchitected deployed native IoT solution . At equipment level sense i.e . listen steam leakage Emerson Rosemount wireless acoustic transmitters configured WirelesHART mesh network attached critical high pressure high capacity steam traps facility . Data collected WirelessHART gateways transmitted local telecom provider Singtel G cellular network analytics software hosted Microsoft Azure cloud platform generation steam trap performance reports . The acoustic patterns condensate acoustic pattern steam . It change sensor monitors reports . Some fascinating facts IoT solution No involvement plant DCS alleviating common concerns interference security DCS . Implementation IoT solution simplified connection DCS . The complete system software sensors provided upfront capital monthly service fee capital expenditure replaced operational expenditure . The steam traps analyzed Denka Emerson Sensing Regional Centre creating additional burden Denka . Creation weekly extension report details failed steam traps needing replacement . Creation monthly savings report information steam leakage equivalent financial loss . After implementing solution steam trap failure rate steam consumption decreased directly impact increasing company bottom line . Smarter Oilfield Operations This smart operations leading O G service provider Cognizant . The client wanted increase efficiency reduce operational costs thousands Electric Submersible Pumps ESPs . ESPs lowered boreholes provide artificial lift underground pressure weak force oil surface . The engineer periodically reset pump motor speed optimize production . This depends good conditions pressure viscosity market prices . Historically reprogramming pump profile requires dispatching engineer oilfield waste time costly proposition requires helicopter travel dangerous land sea location . Cognizant began optimizing problem conducting end to end analysis current systems processes identifying opportunities optimize software hardware processes ESPs . Based analysis Cognizant engineers developed IoT solution efficiently gather sensor information analyze determine optimal ESP settings program settings network . Using pump software developed Cognizant client engineers recalibrate pumps network adjusting motor speed data generated software clicks traveling remote oilfields . This lot pumps time maximizing utilization oilfield reducing costs . The interface enables engineers configure rules prevent equipment failure shutting equipment drill temperature reaches degrees resuming temperature falls degrees . Based software client received alerts impending pump failures enabling preventative measures pump fails . The repair work faster unplanned breakdowns reduced increasing productive time customer satisfaction . The importance IoT understood case efficiency operations greatly increased .
