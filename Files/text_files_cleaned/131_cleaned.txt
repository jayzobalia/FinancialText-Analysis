Big Data To begin explain big data important lives . Big data simply data huge size . Data voluminous growing exponentially time . Such data sets large complex store process traditional data management tools . So huge data ? Social media sites Facebook generate terabytes data day form photos video uploads text messages . A single Jet engine generate terabytes data minutes flight time . With thousand flights day generation data reaches petabytes . Data contained sets structured . It semi structured unstructured . When size dimension data imagine complicated process analyze . Therefore modern methods data analysis developed process information contained big data sets . Opportunities Now coming opportunities Big Data limited healthcare . Big data analysis disruptive technology intervened numerous fields proved worth . Healthcare exception . Big data potential change entire dynamics healthcare industry improve quality life people . Healthcare industry large complicated system . It involves lot risks demands care . However large number patients seek emergency care complications cost rise exponentially . In India times lack sufficient infrastructure support patients deficit beds doctors provide treatment patients . For instance epidemics break lives lost alarming rate easily gauge helplessness . However scenario improving . With advent digitization healthcare system healthcare providers practitioners access huge amount patient health data . This healthcare big data processed analyzed identify patient patterns quickly effectively . The information obtained extremely figure chronic health issues provide preventive treatment plans curb disease disorder occurring . This method predictive analysis crucial benefits big data healthcare . This technology healthcare industry ways infer . Healthcare organizations implemented predictive analysis witnessed reduction ER visits providing support care patients decreasing emergency situations . Apart reduced ER visits timely treatment benefits big data predictive analysis . Patients high risk life threatening issues provided customized treatment facilities . Due lack data exists lack proper planning hospitals . Under over booking staff lack medical equipment medicines facilities result inefficient budgeting ill management finances . Using predictive analysis problems solved lead reduced costs efficient management finances . Better staff allocation admission rate prediction facilitate improvement daily operations healthcare organizations . By big data effect recency bias reduced . When give importance recent events tend ignore effect older lead incorrect decisions . This recency bias . Big data helps preventing fraudulent activities turn prevents losses insurance companies . Challenges While changing healthcare industry easy reap benefits big data . There lot challenges vulnerabilities attached implementation . One biggest challenges security . Healthcare big data personal information health history patients . Acts hacking cyber theft phishing pose threat databases . Such data stolen sold huge sums money . Protection patients privacy challenge big data implementation . Also data external data medical information . The organization care privacy legal compliances government policies . Privacy security patients utmost importance breach kind permitted . The challenge data classification modeling . The size data massive structured heterogeneous . Classifying massive data identify relevant information big challenge . Modeling unstructured data equally difficult . Storage retrieval major challenge . Huge cloud servers sufficient space required store voluminous data . Also speed high uploading data hassle free . The storage challenge retrieval matter concern . Integrating data relevant systems link tough job . The challenge major opinion . Finding talent expertise implement modern technology arduous task . Shortage required talent crisis market today . Even hiring talent challenge retain . Scarce resources data scientists hard find harder retain . They easily poached competitors . A good efficient compensation strategy conducive work environment high incentives opportunities career growth development ways retaining intellectual talent . In nutshell conclude big data disruptive technology bring landmark healthcare dynamics challenges vulnerabilities addressed utmost care sense responsibility .
