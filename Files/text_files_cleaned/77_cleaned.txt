The coronavirus COVID global public health emergency source significant regional increasingly global economic disruption . This impacts energy climate world ways . The economic downturn puts pressure global oil prices leading Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC cuts production . It hurts demand natural gas time extremely low prices . It economic energy climate policymaking environment China consequential energy consumers sources greenhouse gas emissions . And temporarily disrupted supply chains energy industry including renewable energy time supply chain connections China revaluated due ongoing tariff trade disputes . How consequential transformative energy sector climate efforts depend ultimate trajectory virus outbreak Sarah Ladislaw Senior Vice President Director Energy Security Climate Change Program The energy sector felt impacts coronavirus . The outbreak contributed dampened demand oil resulting plummeting oil prices production declines . As move forward energy sector expects face headwinds managing issues health emergency sectors face simultaneously coping low oil price scenario lower demand shore revenue manage debt obligations . IMPACT COVID ENERGY MARKETS In India distribution utilities lower tariff domestic agricultural consumers average cost supply compared commercial industrial consumers . Table electricity tariff rates Delhi selected consumer categories highlight differences . Thus distribution companies lower tariff paying consumers cross subsidized commercial industrial consumers .
