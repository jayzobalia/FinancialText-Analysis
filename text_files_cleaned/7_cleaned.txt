Traffic congestion prediction authorities required time plan allocation resources make journey smooth travelers . Fig Traffic management TACKLE ROAD TRAFFIC CONGESTION traffic management poised revamp urban transportation relieving bottlenecks choke points routinely snarl urban traffic . This reduce congestion travel time reduce emissions . Traffic congestion occurs due negligence factors distance maintained moving vehicles traffic lights road signs . congestion leads higher fuel consumption increased air pollution unnecessarily wastage time energy chronic stress physiological problems higher traffic violations major road fatalities . Intelligent traffic management systems refer usage machine learning computer vision sensors data analysis tools collect analyze traffic data generate solutions apply traffic infrastructure . live camera feeds sensors Google Maps develop traffic management solutions feature predictive algorithms speed traffic flow . Siemens Mobility recently built AI based monitoring system processes video feeds traffic cameras . It automatically detects traffic anomalies alerts traffic management authorities . The system effective estimating road traffic density modulate traffic signals smoother movement . The integration artificial intelligence machine learning support smart transportation applications including emergency vehicle preemption transit signal priority pedestrian safety . AVIATION TRAFFIC CONTROL Air traffic management stands benefit significantly artificial intelligence reliance repetitive activity lends analysis machine learning . In addition complexity embedded driving factors deliver safe air traffic control flight planning flow management safety assessments conflict prediction . FUTURE TRAFIC MANAGEMENT Every year large number vehicles streets worldwide contributing traffic congestion . deep learning technologies play vital role managing traffic collating analyzing data variety sources . Insights accelerate traffic movements . The future traffic management give birth smart applications automate accelerate processes . ADVANTAGES TRAFFIC CONGESTION The Artificial Intelligence Intelligent Traffic Management ITMS tackle solve issues related traffic law enforcement . It facilitate smooth convenient safer experience commuters improving road traffic discipline . Such system law enforcement agencies penalizing offenders act deterrent . Intelligent Traffic Management System ITMS Artificial Intelligence based application coupled cameras installed traffic junctions provide tool detect identify vehicles disobeying traffic rules generate real time alerts Central Command Center . It automatically challan offenders law land send electronically violators . Each e challan supporting evidence data terms snapshots videos . This system track flow pace traffic movement provide real time traffic management . In addition improving traffic conditions ITMS contributes smart city goals environmental sustainability . To improve traffic behavior avoid congestions city Traffic management enforcement system deployed solve traffic related issues including limited Automated Number Plate Reading Red Light Violation Detection Speed Violation Detection Triple Riding No Helmet Detection Free Left Turn Obstruction Wrong Way Driving No Seat Belt Mobile phone usage driving Hot listed vehicle detection Traffic Flow Congestion detection . Such ITMS system integrated existing CCTV Traffic Control system provide holistic solution preventing current traffic menace . Not AI based traffic analytic deployed existing Traffic enforcement surveillance system minor tweaking adjustments resulting highly optimized solution lower cost public exchequer . An AI powered system trained deep learning reduce traffic . Commuters plan journeys system updates . Since takes small detail roads account AI powered system drivers road authorities step ahead . Here significant advantages AI powered system traffic analysis Lane by lane analysis The system analyze traffic lanes precision ease traffic movements . Using data drivers reduce commuting time significantly . Effectively drivers road authorities make decisions avoid traffic congestion . Real time updates driver step ahead Every critical information road conditions road accidents congestion puts driver road authorities step ahead . Wide coverage An AI powered system potential analyze traffic multiple regions . It map efficient routes alter traffic signals improve traffic conditions . Fuel minimization machine learning algorithms identify least efficient vehicles track path speed change traffic signals ahead vehicles . This eliminates inefficient starting stopping intersections minimizes fuel consumption . APPLICATIONS TRAFFIC CONTROL As Artificial Intelligence open space roads concerned considered possibility install AI enabled traffic management system part infrastructure launching self driving vehicles . An AI enabled traffic management system provide greater leeway self driving vehicles directed controlled external environment . Recently Delhi Traffic Police obtained permission Ministry Home Affairs set intelligent traffic management system ITMS work radar based monitoring Artificial Intelligence . One key tools system automated traffic signals . It Delhi Traffic Police analyze traffic pattern volume number vehicles collect cloud manage traffic . It features high resolution CCTV cameras capture commuters motorists breaking laws automated number plate recognition cameras ANPR directly send challan fine slip homes lawbreakers . With Artificial Intelligence working traffic signals based traffic volume congested roads opened longer duration traffic clear leading reduction congestion . CONCLUSION Traffic congestion prediction attention decades . With development infrastructure country facing traffic congestion problem . The development artificial intelligence availability big data led researchers apply models field . Deep learning algorithms popular time assess large data set . However wide range machine learning algorithms applied . Therefore vast opportunity research field traffic congestion prediction prevails . The power propels lot data analysis systems powers navigation systems ride hailing last mile delivery operators . Deliveries order fulfillment delayed past enhanced significantly cities Asia continue taking intelligent traffic systems . Blackcoffer Insights Swapna .
