Even COVID halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak countries notably US India Brazil . It fact Data Analytics big guns artillery fight COVID pandemic . It helped stages outbreak detection outbreak vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing future hotspot detection . Some interesting applications discussed article . A lesser known fact COVID outbreak detected Toronto Canada miles outbreak days issued warning . It Big Data Analytics specifically Deep Learnings DL subset Machine Learning application Natural Language Processing NLP analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province China . The specialty DL algorithms mimic brain cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data . This DL backed software inputs reports public health organizations global airline ticketing data . These flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases . The application Big Data Analytics Research Development drugs halt COVID . analyze protein structure virus findings significant progress vaccine development . In preliminary studies found mutate fast viruses HIV means prophylactic vaccine proceed therapy . But evidence supporting fact find kind cure chance virus mutating happened major mutations found UK Brazil South Africa . assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting set vaccines effective coronavirus . Another interesting application found selection candidates i.e . test positive testing coronavirus case insufficient testing resources . This method exercised Greek borders called project . Whenever traveler wanted Greece fill form Passenger Locator Form PLF hours prior arrival information origin country demographics point date entry intended destination . allocated testing resources size set passengers tested . After test results found positive put quarantine . The results back program real time learning . The question remains made allocations It found statistically origin country city significant factors screening . Ultimately variety countries city pairs predict testing resources allocated entry point passengers location technically called Multi Armed Bandit MAB problem chosen method solve problem algorithm called optimistic Gittins index . This algorithm identified average . x asymptomatic infected travelers random surveillance testing x peak travel . After test results found positive put quarantine . Following collection significant data aforementioned process period policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location . This presented operation August th November st processing PLFs day testing average . households entering country day . Above mentioned applications show tip iceberg developments watch include Image Recognition identify covid based x ray images Deep Learning predict D protein structure COVID .
