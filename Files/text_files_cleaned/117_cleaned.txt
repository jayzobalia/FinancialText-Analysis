Why severe immunological inflammatory explosion affected arms covid ? genetic related immune response il macrophages types scenarios related environmental element ? il marker macrophages essential pre inflammatory marker question directed factor reason brutal response immune system . For Spain parallel treatments administration corticosteroids anti inflammatory drugs . And worrying markers patients increase ferritin values range . The exacerbated response immune system specifically il addition pre inflammatory anti inflammatory function depending synergies occur types receptors . R il gp acts antagonist types proteins typical endothelial cells macrophages . But question severe call il il affected covid . Could virus nexus protein synergy R il binding case acting agonist ? act making call effect . don . My question directed ? abrupt exaggerated call . And short time . Could virus replication speed vs. slower activation speed T B lymphocytes ? In innate immunity Monocytes case macrophages cells present il cell membranes large amount response . It immune response cellular damage DAMP . Why ? Even soluble peptides cathelicidins HDPs react produced cells epithelial tissue respiratory digestive system skin pro anti inflammatory . act chemoattraction agents pro apoptosis case epithelial cells anti apoptotic case neutrophils barrier innate immune system extent producing inflammation severe cell death short time ?
