 Data oil important trendline st century . The reason advancements fields related data analysis . The field Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace fields popular buzzwords days . Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress . This main reason misconception people . ML Stats Data Mining fields related analysis data mistook thing words interchangeably convey thing . But true The similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data information . In academics learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored case articles explain difference . Thus primary confusion learners . Hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions . Then difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining ? The essential difference disciplines lies aims approach achieve aims . The aims fields explained detail sections Artificial Intelligence The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . Then satisfy aim understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? The answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror Yes Humans examples intelligent entities . Thus s researchers began exploring thought process reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . Mimicking human behavior aim initial years research . After setting goal studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human level performance cognitive tasks sufficient fool interrogator . But test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence . Because intelligence related working human brain human brain intelligence meaning Thus mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim . The field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process . The difference understand thought process mimic build . The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain . So basically initial aim human centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent . Concurrently field computer science developing greater pace . With advances computer science experiments theories easily tested validated . As programs applied solve real life problems found computers performed humans tasks complex humans . One examples chess playing program . An program defeated world chess player Garry Kasparov . This incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program . This leads question human intelligence ideal intelligence ? As computers advanced proved humans complex tasks . That definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems . So nature agents researchers began study nature intelligence . Then question test validate intelligence ? The test intelligence solve cognitive problems . An agent intelligent solve complex problem . The problem solving approach easily tested validated computers . Thus researchers began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiments computer . So computer problem solving approach adopted . So human centered approach computer problem solving approach main aims . Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights . Both aims important collaboratively form main aim Machine Learning In problem solving approach big challenge overcome order achieve aim . Consider solving math problem . There cases intelligence tested problem solving approach . Let math problems solve . The problem familiar problem . Consider problem . The problem familiar means solve kind problems solved similar problems past . So question mind solve problem ? The answer solved similar problems past learned past data solve problems haven problem past solve similar problems . This form intelligence . Consider case problem solved kind problems past . Then solve problem consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion . This kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . This kind intelligence . For build intelligent agents kinds intelligence developed agent . But reality reached point build agents learn past data find information . today reached point build agents . That type intelligence . So implement type intelligence Machine Learning So domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning . That reason ML called subset So main difference ML . Technically speaking It field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions patterns explicitly programmed . This statement elaboration . The essence ML related process Generalization learning past data . Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . Consider humans recognize daily life objects . If animal easily recognize dog cat . It trivial task wondered mind ? The answer Generalization If picture dog easily recognize picture dog minds abstracted description dog formulated concept dog concepts learned past experiences dog . So dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds . With generalization real information . So give computers ability generalize raw data convert information patterns trends data . Statistics This discipline concerns collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data . Statistics deal data aim explain . So study explaining data Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics . Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data Descriptive statistics . It explain information easily large data complex task . Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data . We inference tasks daily lives . Consider simple case cooking soup . After completing recipe taste small sample spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad . Depending result sample make inference soup soup good bad . Similarly statistics cases apply inference meaningful information . For case gather data time consuming costly . In cases applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty . That inferential statistics . So data context uncertainty decision making face uncertainty statistics deals . So data statistics explain data . This aim resonate ML statistics fields correctly interpret data Data Mining Data raw form . Consider examples sensors industrial applications . These sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature pressure . The raw data generated sensors converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insights solve problem Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insights Data Mining referred Knowledge Discovery . That Carly Fiorina CEO Hewlett Packard The goal turn data information information Insight . This statement completely explains aim Data Mining So difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims . But approaches fields fulfilling aims fields . This beauty fields Blackcoffer Insights Abhishek Govekar Vishwakarma Institute Technology Pune India .
