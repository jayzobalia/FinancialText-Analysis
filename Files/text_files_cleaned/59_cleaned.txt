When talk people perspectives . There group people good knowledge real potential solution problems world facing today . There group people threatened thought taking world . The field birth Alan Turing thought Can machines ? . Later s adoption expert systems companies world booming field initiated . Initially matter awe results achieve . growth past decades exponential transformed live work solve challenges . made impact wide variety areas including healthcare education business . But areas highest impact made recently environment climate change . Is Revolutionizing deal Environment Climate Change ? strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision making decarbonising industries building transport work allocate renewable energy . In recent years game changer people organizations deal climate change . Microsoft believes artificial intelligence encompassing machine learning deep learning game changer climate change environmental issues . The company Earth program committed million years create test applications . increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid handle power fluctuations improve energy storage . Wind companies turbine propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating real time weather operational data . improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters Internet Things internet computing devices embedded everyday objects enabling send receive data forecast energy demand . Besides artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances flood plains urban planning disaster preparedness . One vision sustainable city create urban dashboard consisting real time data energy water availability traffic weather make cities energy efficient livable . Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture . Data sensors field monitor crop moisture soil composition temperature improve production crops watering . Incorporating information drones monitor conditions increasingly automatic systems times plant spray harvest crops head diseases problems . This result increased efficiency enhanced yields lower water fertilizer pesticides . But good downside ? When talk effect environment climate sides coin elucidated . So positives discussed usage downside . Last year World Economic Forum report showed address Earth environmental challenges important manage properly . According forum experts field potential accelerate environmental degradation . The power intensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C emissions . Although half century question environmental impact ethical issues arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data strong computational power . For advances enabled artificial intelligence speech recognition self driving cars systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate changing carbon emissions . A study year found training off the shelf language processing system produced pounds emissions amount produced flying person roundtrip New York San Francisco . But ways make machine learning cleaner greener movement called Green AI. Some algorithms power hungry training sessions moved remote locations power renewable sources . The key developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reduced . What ? To prevent proposition World Economic Forum report advancements safe pursued ensure humanity developing harmful environment . Specifically World Economic Forum report developers incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension. This means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable factors . In sense programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind . In future development programs important note environmental impact creating systems place . According academic study energy usage deep learning processes creation effective costly environment . Nearly kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model . This basically equal emissions average cars United States . Considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate change crucial moving forward . There room improvement pioneers machine learning recently published paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed major conference . David Rolnick postdoctoral fellow University Pennsylvania call arms means bring researchers . This paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning including energy production CO removal education solar geoengineering finance . The main idea build energy efficient buildings creating low carbon materials high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources . Artificial intelligence machine learning medium real work caretaker mother earth . How forecasting climate change ? The kick start climate informatics regulates collaboration data science climate science . It covers wide range topics improving prediction extreme events hurricanes paleoclimatology collecting data ice cores climate up down scaling impact . There lot uncertainty Monteleoni Claire Monteleoni computer science professor University Colorado concludes AI ML models generally forecast short term . There significant difference long term forecasting . The system developed Princeton s . All AI ML models developed till revolve atmosphere oceans land cryosphere ice . achieve heights amount data collected point time compute complex climate conditions climate modeling algorithms . What showing effects extreme weather ? We climate change real rise atmospheric temperature proof make realistic Montreal Institute Learning Algorithms Microsoft ConscientAI Labs Generative Adversarial Networks popularly GANs simulate mother earth rising sea levels atmospheric temperature air pollution intensive storms . Our goal convince people climate change real people real Victor Schmidt co author paper Ph.D. candidate The project deployed people places future significant climate change . Can track carbon emissions ? Short answer . Tracking carbon emission agendas . For year goal prevent coal plants built . Satellite images picture deep learning techniques data science researchers analyze high quality satellite images track emission . Google expanding horizon nonprofit satellite imagery including gas powered plants emissions researchers track pollution . There countries organizations govern CO emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations . automate analysis images power plants regular updates emissions . It introduces ways measure plant impact crunching numbers nearby infrastructure electricity . That beneficial gas powered plants don easy to measure plumes coal powered plants .
