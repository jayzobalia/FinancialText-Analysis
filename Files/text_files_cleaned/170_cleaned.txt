If talk terms general life Exfiltrate means surreptitiously move personnel material area enemy control . In terms Computer science Data Exfiltration unauthorized removal data network e.g . leakage Archives Passwords Additional Malware Utilities Personally identifiable information financial data trade secrets source code intellectual property . For hacker easy move things box . E.g . RAR file ZIP file CAB file . Data Exfiltration outbound FTP HTTPS common days . CHANNEL Source https urlzs.com L bf The main characteristic covert channel aimed hiding fact communication taking place . This differs cryptography intention camouflage transmission data goal make data readable useable solely receiver . The oldest form covert channel steganography intention avoid drawing suspicion transmission hidden message . Source https urlzs.com GiJX Covert channels evolved tattooing messages slaves scalp embedding information features TCP IP protocol . Although formal definition covertness field computer science exist research detection covert communication active . Informally operation covert difficult detect special tools specifically . For suppose detect user printing documents printer network convenience refer user simply John . Suppose set network tools records communication John workstation printer . The detect John prints walks printer pick page . Alternatively detect time print discover printer frequently busy John waiting print jobs complete . If John operation hidden print lower rate page day . Nobody detect . If printing day long highest rate operation easily recognizable . Even printing half maximum rate makes process noticeable . If abstract concept obtain Covertness characteristic operation measured rate usage media . If apparatus exploited maximum capacity operation easily visible covertness zero exploited lesser rate operation increasingly covert . In words measure covertness function distance capacity medium . Therefore activity covert rate usage compared capacity equipment low . The closer capacity rate operation transmission executed covert transmission . Covertness proportional difference capacity actual rate Covertness Capacity medium Transmission Rate Define kinds threats unauthorized disclosure information unauthorized modification information unauthorized withholding information called denial service
