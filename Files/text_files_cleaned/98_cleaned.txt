 The past prepared future. Theodore Roosevelt As speak world finds engulfed worst crises recent times . The global COVID pandemic caused never seen before disruption public economic life . Not factories shut supply chains abruptly stopped millions workers stranded festivals suspended families separated countries public healthcare systems put tremendous stress . Such scenario first time world pandemics similar scale nature due struggle emerged victoriously . As experienced remember SARS MERS outbreaks early s presented similar scenario lower rate infection higher rates morbidity . Going back time Spanish Flu brought world world war standstill . Considered worst modern era pandemics Influenza pandemic affected one third world population million lives . Yet preventive measures social distancing quarantine mass vaccinations public support restraint proved successful situations effective occasional plague outbreaks world . We face similar situation today extremely infectious virus spread globally confined people homes causing tremendous economic loss minute economic activity remains suspended affecting government industries alike . Can past similar incidents guide industries times ? Can governments note public policy measures adopted Spanish flu SARS MERS outbreak helped eliminating pandemics ? What Government learn ? The panic due outbreak COVID importantly lockdown measures deal similar Influenza Pandemic commonly referred Spanish Flu . Large cities world put strict lockdowns businesses worldwide grinding halt large chunks population bedridden . The consequences observed past weeks rampant unemployment supply shortages heavy reliance social security systems causing sudden strain national economic resources . Impact Learnings Information Censorship Effective transparent communications crucial tools disease control . Iran presents great damage unleashed media blackout . Secondly censorship appease masses times . The long term political impact media censorship manipulation epidemic related facts China . Still short term international unrest dissent deteriorated international relations . At risk quoting clich established Streisand effect truth matter countries hide . Isolation Lockdown Distancing Mechanisms Work The Spanish Flu spread aggravated due failure policymakers adopting effective containment measures . Research shows US cities undertook measures reduce contact citizens early displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared cities failed late adopt disease containment policies . To quote results study Consistent hypothesis cities multiple interventions implemented early phase epidemic peak death rates lower less steep epidemic curves . They displayed lower cumulative mortality. Contrasting Death Rates Philadelphia v. St. Louis Influenza Outbreak Contrasting Death Rates Philadelphia v. St. Louis Influenza Outbreak As guess Philadelphia late levy restrictions gatherings parades social distancing measures St. Louis . From study definition popular phrase flattening curve emerging spreading rate infection time enabling health care systems treat people staggered manner line resources . And corroborate result graph study shows trajectories disease cities US . Hence multiple debunking claims social distancing lockdown effective preventive mechanism previous epidemics taught perform marvelous job flattening curve . Premature Relaxation Disastrous Social Distancing Lockdown measures effective sustained months things start improve . Markel shows disastrous consequences early relaxation bans public gatherings St. Louis death rates Spanish flu . The pullback social distancing measures pursue economic interests premature caused sudden unprecedented surge number deaths due flu . Deaths due Spanish Flu St. Louis A Wider Picture . The black grey lines show duration social distancing measures active . Deaths due Spanish Flu St. Louis A Wider Picture . The black grey lines show duration social distancing measures active . Another peak death rates observed cities relaxed distancing measures prematurely . Hence crucial past artifact governments compare inconveniences public damage caused economy due measures benefits nation terms human life saved make call restrictions eased . What industry learn ? The industry played key role obscure fight worldwide outbreak . But faces fair share challenges unprecedented times . Supply Shortages due shut down factories production houses uncertainty production systems resume normal functioning.Transport disruptions due closure quarantining cities state borders nation wide lockdowns bringing transportation standstill significant disruptions supply chains goods.Labour issues restrictions movement issues labour welfare unrest employment security . This problem labour force migratory nature . Global industries weathered multiple natural disasters epidemics similar scale nature . Their recovery paths immense strategic implications current policy makers offer strategic insights helping companies chart short term long term strategies . This graph retail sales impact SARS epidemic China earthquake tsunami Fukushima nuclear disaster Japan MERS epidemic South Korea . This graph retail sales impact SARS epidemic China earthquake tsunami Fukushima nuclear disaster Japan MERS epidemic South Korea . Three phases characterise impact retail market cases ShockRecoveryStabilization The paths inevitably converge stabilization follow trajectories swayed public perceptions externalities case mid autumn festival South Korea . Looking retail sector micro lens past crises show demand trends vary product categories post crisis . The categories follow trends Demand Trends post Pandemic generated Crisis Demand Trends post Pandemic generated Crisis Demand Trends post Pandemic generated Crisis These trends valuable tool large scale players regional retailers means prioritize predict consumer demand alleviate sudden strain product supply chain arising sudden unexpected demands . Change Consumer Behaviour A peculiar outcome epidemics permanent instilled consumer buying trends inflicted regions product categories Fresh staples sharp rise demand product hygiene safety standards ranked higher consumers priority list . Hence advantage lies producers quickly integrate changed consumer preferences products showcase product reliability quality priced competitively prevalent context . Lastly previous pandemics consolidated long standing theory true retail sector consumer centric industry Consumer Loyalty tested times . Effective Consumer Relationship Management CRM forge bonds long weathering thick thin unprecedented times . Implications Almost decades ago SARS outbreak China pushed entrepreneurs established players embrace dawn e commerce era . This outbreak expected accelerate shift conventional brick mortar based commerce centralized online cloud store based mechanism . Survival FMCG sector decided great extent breadth supply chain networks ability overcome severe bottlenecks . The past shown established large scale players deep pockets extensive networks likelier chance tough hard times regional players SMEs make strengthened community support empathy importantly local relationships . What fail learn ? This global pandemic outbreak made thing painfully clear lack global collaborative research ways combat spread infectious diseases . In words Johan Neyts professor virology president Belgian based International Society Antiviral Research ISAR health authorities failed incorporate learnings SARS outbreak early s partly economic crisis squeezed funds potential research undertaken partly lack seriousness authorities efforts involved dealing future expected breaks coronavirus due strains existence . The Way forward ? All lessons caveat Things change time . The modes communication changed . Both information travel accessible . We fast planes faster internet . We healthcare capabilities perfect healthcare system . In people didn virus causing pandemic eradication . Today extensive research probable vaccines virus record setting pace clinical trials approvals . We equipped years ago time under equipped deal . But lessons similar crises humanity faced risen act glimmer hope dire times put good aid fight COVID . In words Howard Markel There time human history pandemic today exception week month . You kick road today. Blackcoffer Insights Nishant Kumar Satyam Vasu Golyan
