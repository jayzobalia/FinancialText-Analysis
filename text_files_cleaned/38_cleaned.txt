The Covid pandemics forced factories shut flights canceled massive decrease global economy significant decrease Green House Gases GHG developed developing countries . The SARS CoV spotlight December impacted countries till . Nearly million peoples infected worldwide resulting deaths . Million World Health Organisation . Most countries dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus . These policies caused adverse effects worldwide . One important impacts Covid Pandemic environment . There positive impacts environment due lockdown air pollution decreased dramatically people asked stay houses due lockdowns . There sharp decline environmental noise . Environmental noise defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities noise emitted road traffics air traffics rail traffics industrial activities . It important challenges modern era noise pollution adverse effects humans harm animals . The imposition lockdown quarantine nation governments caused people remain back homes . Because movement people place place reduced significantly personal public transport decreased . Due environmental noise generated cities dropped substantially . Water Pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted back cities covid virus generated negative indirect effect environment . To begin developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic . In United States European nation States waste recycling plants suspended municipalities cities due concern virus spread recycling centers . This resulted increase single use plastic bags re usable bags leading restaurants firms corporations . For instance Starbucks leading coffee company month March announced short lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups . Furthermore people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores shops restaurants food outlets closed making online purchase food delivery high . This created consumption demand fossil fuels due transportation mobility goods individual . There enormous upsurge medical waste products employed healthcare professionals single use items disposed . Some wastes include masks personal protection kits gloves . For instance tons medical waste generated peak pandemic breakout Wuhan China . This tones average waste generated outbreak Wuhan . These organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment environmental issues water pollution air pollution soil erosion harm local flora fauna . The demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non woven fabrics . Polyester Polystyrene polyethylene polycarbonate common materials surgical mask density lying grams grams sq . meter . These materials resistant liquids plastic based products high afterlife discarded . If treated properly discarding end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms . For recently environment Hong Kong started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes . With recycling plants hold piles small mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day . This makes surrounding vulnerable creating high risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane CH greenhouse gas increasing risk global warming . Not surroundings affected careless methods local people affected . If excess methane accumulated Earth atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes result increases Earth average temperature harmful future generations . Many protected endangered flora fauna facing greater risks due imposition lockdown . Many countries lockdown made people stay inside homes . The employees NGOs volunteers working protected areas National Parks Marine Conservation Zones wildlife sanctuaries made stay home making protected endangered flora fauna unattended . This led increase illegal activities wildlife hunting illegal deforestation fishing activities due absence people . The prohibition eco tourism led significant financial drop economy protected areas . Some nations China asked local authorities native government bodies increase amount disinfection routine increase dosage chlorine wastewater treatment plant prevent spread COVID virus . However solid evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater drinking water . Despite fact excessive amounts chlorine water harmful problems issues people health bladder cancer damages cells . The COVID reminder health planet linked health humans . Evidence proves virus zoonotic meaning transmitted people animals . They accountable seventy five percent emerging infectious diseases World . With Virus infecting millions people day globe Various governments agencies top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes clinical medical waste . Likewise time responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears . In Spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic History witnessed rise pollution post financial crisis . A similar case observed financial crash temporary decrease emissions . observed economy recovered emissions all time high . After sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic . To prevent future outbreaks address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife including habitat loss illegal trade pollution climate change human life depends Earth life . If live spacious outdoor area desert empty road lined trees realize safe surface less space walk begin realize beauty nature . The point remain indoors avoid close contact . When leave home walk desert run street make wipe surfaces contact avoid touching face frequently wash hands . Blackcoffer Insights Saujanya Roy Indian Maritime University Kolkata
