Challenges There explosion electronic clinical data analyzed glean insights improve health healthcare . Two data quality issues systematic data inaccuracies data fragmentation addressed order ensure insight electronic clinical data valid . These issues require specific attention policymakers practitioners lessened promoting greater interoperability reducing burdensome documentation requirements . There enormous enthusiasm big data address persistent cost quality deficiencies healthcare system . The notion simply analyzing massive amount clinical information newly digital format enable groundbreaking insights Earlier detection effective treatments Better targeted clinical decision support Real time biosurveillance Accurate predictions sick . Will Transforming Healthcare Deliver Its Promises ? It harnessing data create Institute Medicine calls learning health system healthcare continuously identify adopt approaches deliver care lower costs . Big data generated excitement recent election analysts vast amounts disparate data polls economic indicators historical trends predict election outcomes astounding accuracy . Yet excitement big data analytics requires appears ahead reality . Without specific attention challenges important tool transforming healthcare fail deliver promise . Healthcare Data Are Big But Are They Good ? The set challenges confront big data efforts . Healthcare continual technical advances store efficiently access rapidly expanding amount data . There challenges salient healthcare . The challenge demands significantly attention ensuring data big good . Healthcare problem big . The rate electronic health record adoption continues climb inpatient ambulatory settings . Health record adoption large scale capture clinical care hospitals outpatient visits countless pharmacies laboratories sites . And increasingly patients devices track health health related behaviors generate substantial data . The Healthcare space achieved big exponential growth ahead . Healthcare Data Quality The problem healthcare lies quality data . To derive insights data critical accurate complete . When data systematically biased errors omissions correlations give rise insights missed spurious result misguided confidence scarce resources dedicated chasing dead ends . Healthcare disproportionately concerned data quality reasons . First large fraction data entered humans intentionally unintentionally introduce systematic errors . In domains data natural byproduct healthcare increasing reliance technology . Internet searches online purchases cell phone calls create treasure trove data mined patterns flu symptom searches experimentation buy cart upper upper left ? . The opportunities data error limited easily identified algorithms . Hard Way Solve Healthcare Data Quality Issue In healthcare critical clinical data symptoms physical signs orders progress notes rely heavily human entry foreseeable future . Beyond simple data entry errors bigger systemic problems clinical data electronic format . Current reimbursement policies require extensive documentation clinicians respond templates automatically populate large quantities data copy paste features propagate mistakes outdated information . Further physician documentation styles vary substantially making errors omissions difficult identify . For instance patient empty medication list patient taking medications patient informed physician medication taking physician chosen document medications ? Systematic data inaccuracies quick fixes . The helpful long term solution payers Medicare relax documentation requirements providers focus data entry clinical billing . Technical Solutions Healthcare Data Quality Issue Alternatively promising technical solutions machine learning form artificial intelligence trains systems make predictions characteristics data . While machine learning proved successful identifying missing diagnoses limited critical clinical data symptoms physical exam findings . In addition richest source clinical data clinicians notes remains largely reach big data . There substantial improvements natural language processing NLP identify key information clinical notes . However quality notes improves hard NLP programs glean important information . Continued investment technical solutions undoubtedly improve data accuracy fundamental care documented healthcare circumspect healthcare ability rid data systematic errors . Data Fragmentation Healthcare Even healthcare achieves perfect data accuracy daunting challenge remains data fragmentation . Incomplete data common clinical practice reflect healthcare space highly fragmented healthcare system patients multiple clinicians electronic health record communicate . Despite significant policy interest healthcare achieve meaningful level interoperability creating comprehensive picture patients care impossible . Incomplete data inaccurate data lead missed spurious associations wasteful harmful patient care . The solutions addressing fragmented data easier address inaccurate data . Achieving greater interoperability electronic clinical systems pursued policymakers decades success . While policymakers recently renewed efforts primary focus moving specific pieces clinical information laboratory test result individual healthcare providers ensure provider organization comprehensive picture patient care care sites . Many patients privacy advocates understandably concerned efforts aggregate data . However adequate de identification security safeguards risks aggregation minimized benefits care lower costs substantial . Conclusion The potential big data healthcare enormous exciting . It hard find delivery system thinking leverage electronic health record data researchers eager answer types questions . Realizing healthcare large national investment health demands healthcare space learns newly data . Doing requires healthcare understand issues data quality address effectively . The solutions easy . However ignoring challenges quickly lead healthcare hope big data disappointing wasteful results bad data .
