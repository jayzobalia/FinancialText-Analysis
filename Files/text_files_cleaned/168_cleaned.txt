Introduction Inventory planning fundamental part retail operations . Proper retail inventory management helps balance supply demand relies heavily accurate forecast future demand . In fact sales forecasting refers predicting future demand sales assuming factors affected demand past affecting present influence future . It important task difficult accomplish . In retailing industry defined retailing business products including apparel shoes fashion beauty products forecasting treated service represents set analytical tools facilitate companies make decisions predicting future . Undoubtedly good forecasting service system avoid understocking over stocking retail inventory planning relates critical operations supply chain due date management production planning pricing achieving high customer service level . In order achieve economics sustainability highly competitive environment company adopt consumer demand driven pull operational strategy means forecasting critically important task . Compared retailing service industries argued sales forecasting difficult task fashion retailing fashion product demand highly volatile ever changing taste consumers fashion product life cycle short . In addition sales fashion products strongly affected stochastically seasonal factors fashion trend factors tricky variables e.g. weather marketing strategy political climate item features macroeconomic trend . These fact fashion retailers carrying large number stock keeping units SKUs limited historical sales data make sales forecasting challenging call sophisticated versatile analytical tools . On hand fashion apparel supply chain long includes upstream cotton plants fiber manufacturers apparel factories distributors wholesalers retailers . As consequence notorious bullwhip effect strong influence fashion supply chain . Since forecasting critical factor relating presence significance bullwhip effect improving forecasting reduce bullwhip effect directly enhances efficiency fashion supply chain . Statistical Fashion Sales Forecasting Methods Traditionally fashion sales forecasting accomplished statistical methods . In fact lot statistical methods sales forecasting includes linear regression moving average weighted average exponential smoothing trend present linear exponential smoothing trend double exponential smoothing Bayesian analysis . Statistical time series analysis tools ARIMA SARIMA widely employed sales forecasting . Since methods closed form expression forecasting simple easy implement results computed quickly . Fashion Retail Sales Forecasting Methods The pure statistical models deficiency conducting fashion retail forecasting order improve forecasting accuracy . methods emerge advance computer technology . In fact models efficiently derive arbitrarily nonlinear approximation functions directly data . Popular methods artificial neural network models fuzzy logic models commonly employed literature kind models employed fashion retail sales forecasting . To specific models developed provide satisfactory results domains . Hybrid Methods Fashion Sales Forecasting Hybrid forecasting methods developed based fact utilize strengths models form forecasting method . As considered efficient pure statistical models pure models . It surprising recent years number research works examine hybrid forecasting methods . Hybrid methods employed fashion forecasting literature combine schemes fuzzy model ELM techniques statistical models grey model GM . Following adapted hybrid methods Fuzzy Logic Based Hybrid Methods Neural Network Based Hybrid Methods ELM Based Hybrid Methods Applications Fashion Industry Sales forecasting real world problem fashion retailing . From perspective applications implementation issues identified . In terms forecasting horizon existing forecasting models suitable middle term long term forecasting . However short term forecasting including short term forecasting real time forecasting fully explored . This kind short term forecasting important nature fashion industry fashion trend unpredictable lead time short . Regarding product type forecasted kinds products involved existing product product . Compared existing products forecasting prediction product forecasting complicated difficult due absence historical sales data . In terms speed general statistical methods output forecasting results quickly . methods time consuming . In past lead time fashion industry bit longer lead time ten months year . However fashion industry changed fast fashion companies ZARA H M Mango adopting quick response strategy short lead time e.g. weeks Zara products . As result forecasting result short time forecasting application companies .
