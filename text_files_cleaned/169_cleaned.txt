 . The Problem Insider threat detection specifically detect data exfiltration network challenge . Existing perimeter security solutions end system security effectively devised handle insider attack data exfiltration . Issues misconfiguration vulnerable points covert network channels lead data exfiltration . Hence building effective system detecting insider attacks remains open challenge . Devising exclusive behavior based model essential detect data exfiltration network utilizing parameters system network . . Motivation Nowadays thousands companies organizations subject cyber attack . Many hackers exist company organization hacking breaking information systems execute cyber attacks . But nowadays insiders hackers exist inside company organization big problem insiders overloaded potential threats commit cyber attack . Usually apply kind security policies access control policies aimed prevent data business policy product information secret information . fails trust give him her full access network host etc. leak data information . This reason insider attacks damaging costly due knowledge access information system . From recent survey institutions researchers quarter cyber attacks insiders . . Insider Threat An insider threat malicious hacker called cracker black hat employee officer business institution agency . Insider threats disgruntled employees ex employees business institution agency wrong feel justified gaining revenge . It difficult detect prevent attacks people legitimate access organization computers networks represent growing problem digital world . These insider threats frustrate employers lack resources identify monitor behavior . Insiders employees today include contractors business partners auditors alumnus valid email address . Define insider trusted entity power violate security policy . The insider determined reference established security policy . Insider threat lies access ability violate security policy legitimate access violate access control policy obtaining unauthorized access . . Insider Type There types insiders result information leakage Inadvertent Intentional Malicious . An inadvertent insider trusted person access sensitive information inadvertently discloses sensitive information . An intentional insider trusted person knowingly discloses sensitive information aware security purposefully bypassing . This person manipulate content overt communication preserves privacy avoid detection . A malicious insider trusted person knowingly discloses sensitive information . However addition manipulating content overt communication international insider tunneled covert communication employed avoid detection . . Data Exfiltration If talk terms general life exfiltrate means surreptitiously move personnel material area enemy control . In terms computer science data exfiltration unauthorized removal data network . E.g . leakage archives passwords additional malware utilities personally identifiable information financial data trade secrets source code intellectual property . For hacker easy move things box . E.g . RAR file ZIP file CAB file . Data Exfiltration outbound FTP HTTPS common days . Data Exfiltration Network medium common . For FTP HTTP SMTP SSH INSTANT ROOTKITS BATNETS SPYWARE CHANNELS PHISHING PHARMING MITM medium data exfiltration simple insider . Exploits Privilege escalation DNS Poisoning Directory traversal common attack insider . If talk Physical medium data exfiltration play major role . For printing device CD DVD DISC USP LAPTOP . common medium insider data exfiltration . . The solution detecting Data Exfiltration Network Presenting behavior approach based Chi Square model detect insider attack specifically data exfiltration . The approach focuses technical behavioral aspects present methods detect data exfiltration . Firstly learning phase profile host network compute Chi Square values individually system network parameters . Secondly detection phase compute Chi Square values identified parameters superimpose current Chi Square values learned Chi Square values detect data exfiltration network . Aim develop method identify abnormal cyber behavior establishing user profiles based cyber data collected user active computer . To implement learning algorithms establish normal behavioral profiles users . Monitor users anomalies behavior patterns . It important state goal identify abnormalities . For identify user uploading abnormally large amount file directory typically access . Fig .
