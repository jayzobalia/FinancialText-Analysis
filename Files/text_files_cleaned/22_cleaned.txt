Introduction Where disruptive technology taking ? Take leave disruptive technology creates jobs depleted jobs . You notice jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots machines technology creating machines replace . Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios artificial intelligence Big Data Machine Learning ML algorithms predict drive consumer behavior . Data Analytics tools Google Analytics today free correctly organizations save millions billions dollars sales marketing . How machine replace humans ? Before level set constitutes machines . In context article machines describe computers computerized equipment robots programmed learn humans . Occasionally call Artificial Intelligence times call machine learning times call robotics . And technically things . These bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day . They tough tasks considered difficult human . But broad discussion related future work totally interrelated . Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside . A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily . But forward step advancement technology threat proliferating threat replaced work front . Every passing day sealing jobs humans globe . Similarly turn hand drawn sketches humans digital source code . Role Machines Companies future Companies developing robotics expertise idea technological innovations ll cut costsincrease efficienciesoffer propositionsexecute business models . Of machines creatives working . In Amazon employed robots warehouses efficiently move things increased warehouse workforce . Humans Amazon case picking packing goods robots move orders giant warehouses essentially cutting walking required workers making Amazon pickers efficient tired. Plus robots Amazon pack shelves cars rush hour traffic longer aisle space humans . The greater density shelf space means inventory roof means selection customers. Why Machines replace humans ? During decades sooner notion work handled human virtual hinge predictability . As starting today machines manage routine humans unpredictable tasks require creativity problem solving flexibility . In context robotics means improve operations efficiency improve quality life workers . Although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation true highly repetitive tasks and mechanical ones are ideal robots . Besides greater efficiency speed automation leads lower risk accidents greater control autonomy fewer costs organizations . Are Machines diligent humans ? Although artificial intelligence machine learning make robots endowed superior intelligence fact don ability learn experience respond unknowns . So things stand processing speed automatic learning robot doesn beat factors innate human brain . Humans essential part process . Think delivering services client . Most customer challenges routine humans play important role addressing issues solving time consolidating process system . Machines . Humans Which premium ? While machines humans proximity robots expensive doesn apply types based Robotic Process Automation RPA development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs . Moreover domestic robots be vacuum cleaner lawn mower pool cleaner are increasingly part daily lives . This level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control security comfort . Man Machines The division humans machines clear machine boundary fuzzier . Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies making lost limbs providing additional strength stability resilience exoskeletons donned assembly line workers . We smartphones symbiotically integrated directly bodies ? Think smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain . Think sounds science fiction ? Think . The prototypes built . Soon brain computer interfaces seamless creating synergistic relationship cloud . At point question moot question answer . Sometimes answer stored neural circuitry time connection neurons web . Our brain decision process influenced educated cultural context . These external factors influencing decision processes point situations legitimately claim influence strong brains held accountable choices made . The point make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools physical conceptual taught . My guess transformation subtle . Conclusion Practically speaking robots growing point world start creating smarter robots impractical concern . None expected future long shot . If ve ATM waited PC boot catastrophic failure game crash box reach checkpoint understand world machines perfectly . Before jobs flawlessly depend humans mess lives . This isn win or lose situation . We wind partner smarter machines partnership fostered augmentation technology . Machines play essential role augmentation successful technology fall level perception .
