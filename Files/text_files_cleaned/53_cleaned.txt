Introduction The definition consciousness controversial centuries title familiar mysterious aspects lives . An idea concept awareness beings surroundings perception . The reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness isn observable unlike brain matter studied scientifically . physical clarification awareness general sense incomplete doesn include feels subject subject . There likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness . As suggested incident Eastern Shamir traditions consciousness universal primal . Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years research hasn answer questions relating nature emotions experiences . History Beginning late nineteenth century time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind typically equated consciousness . As result analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain . The Ancient Mayans propose sorted feeling degree consciousness purpose worldly association mankind . Since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature interior stimuli Mayans trusted essential type existence equipped evolution . The Incas thought consciousness movement mindfulness worry . John Locke early philosopher consciousness individuality freelanced substances . He detected reason consciousness stuck specific body mind consciousness transferred body mind . Karl Marx early thinker denies mind body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities settings . William James American psychologist differentiated consciousness stream unbroken continuous shifts . While main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors primary half twentieth century analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly s . In Sigmund Freud psychoanalytic theory believed levels awareness preconscious conscious unconscious responsible behavior thinking . He believed mid divided parts id ego superego . The Id present birth instinctual operates pleasure principle . The ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy . Finally superego internalization society moral standards responsible guilt . Now Id regarded unconscious ego superego conscious preconscious . Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches didn conduct scientific experiments work heavily scrutinized leaving questions unanswered . Sigmund Freud theory differed psychologists theories understandable easily conveyed people . Sigmund Freud work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth character memory sexuality therapy . However theories subject considerable criticism life . Whilst John Locke William James practical approach mystery conducting experiments Sigmund Freud didn provide evidence support claims . Brain Today essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally . Issues interest include phenomena perception blindsight brainwaves sleep altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs . A greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters . However confirm criticalness verbal reports researchers contrast action brain that search neural connections consciousness . Hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain pattern global brain activity greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness . A brain imaging strategies EEG MRI scans utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations . A investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain isn adequate create consciousness workable subjects report absence awareness event areas primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus . Higher brain areas viewed encouraging prefrontal cortex involved range high order functions . One mainstream theory implicates examples brain waves creating conditions consciousness . Analysts record mind waves drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum electroencephalograph EEG placing electrodes scalp . The types brain waves alpha beta theta delta correspond mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep deeply asleep Memory Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory . This capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past . The hippocampus located brain temporal lobe responsible type memory . Consciousness plays part important memory distinctions . One distinction implicit explicit characteristics explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious . Furthermore empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness . Working memory operates maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks . The current ways testing information lacking essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution scope . Examples methods PET fMRI EEG implanted electrodes . PET fMRI temporal resolution problems EEG well known localizability difficulties implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons restricted scope . Hence huge numbers speculations testable fundamental level difficult test . Mental illness Consciousness influence objects encourages settle choices communicate . Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems agnosia failure decipher visual data Alzheimer disease autism . However don comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object . Several disorders consciousness include locked in syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma brain death . Locked in syndrome called pseudo coma condition patient aware move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body vertical eye developments squinting . The individual conscious speak eye movements . In minimally conscious state patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness . Patients give restricted reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance . This straightforward orders comprehensible speech purposeful conduct . In persistent vegetative state patient sleep wake cycles lacks awareness communicate displays reflexive non purposeful behavior . The term refers organic body grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse Like coma chronic coma results generally cortical white matter harm neuronal axonal injury central brainstem sores . Usually metabolism grey matter decreases normal range . The patient lies eyes shut doesn environmental factors . Brain death irreversible end brain activity function including involuntary activity sustain life . The main total necrosis cerebral neurons loss brain oxygenation . After brain death patient lacks sense awareness sleep wake cycles behavior typically dead deep sleep state . Future predictions conclusion As history scholar endeavors study consciousness empirically nature defined scientific methods . In past psychologists Descartes dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics . In battle realists illusionists taking sides fundamentally impossible topic doesn concrete evidence . As observe neural examinations brain detect consciousness sensory sector brain aware event clear signs reaction stimulus . Similarly consciousness plays major role memory lack facilities research fully . In future possibility access facilities find neural connections ties mental illness . Not people making aware perspective things give chance recognizing signs mental illness issues . As researchers continue study unknown part mind fund recover global pandemic answer psychology difficult questions . Blackcoffer Insights Amara Arora Vaanya Kaushal Scottish High International School
