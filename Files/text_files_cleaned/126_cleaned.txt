Disruption Fintech The Lightning Network Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology time . Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin based Blockchain technology making entry formal finance world increasingly medium exchange . Though potential cases Cryptocurrencies Indian Government critical implementing technology banking finance lot issues resolved commercially transactions . Some important drawbacks Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin Scalability Bitcoin transactions compared payment network giants VisaThere block limit MB amounts GBs min Bitcoin block match transactions . This essentially means home computers process limited cases transactions requiring devices high computational powerCentralization High computation power requirement limit usage network afford itThis eventually lead fewer validations Distributed Ledger defeating purpose Blockchain . A distributed ledger means network validate transaction parties So important cheaply validation mechanism carried basic broadband connection in home small business computers . If people personal transaction history unimportant posted main blockchain time transaction takes place bloat blockchain . Moreover everyday transactions cryptocurrency cost posting transaction . Let buying coffee price coffee . Introducing The Lightning Network Lightning Network latest disruptive technology researched Fintech make cryptocurrencies scalable . It basically adds extra layer top main Bitcoin Blockchain enables payment channels parties layer . Micropayments everyday transactions easily carried channel . Here works Suppose A buys coffee nearby coffee shop B daily work . A B decide open channel Blockchain everyday transactions . Once channel Lightning Network open parties track daily transactions ledger . At end month ledger reflecting balances left party decide close channel . This final transaction recorded main Bitcoin Blockchain . This reduces cost transaction enables micropayments everyday transactions . Micropayment channels defer updating main blockchain remaining balances date . A large network micropayments created secondary layer top main blockchain address scalability issue reduce transaction fees . Although solution initial stages resolving scalability issue reducing transaction fees taking transaction main blockchain give big boost Cryptocurrencies . How payments place lightning network ? The parties exchange single key validation spend transactions . They conduct unlimited number transactions channel finally party closes channel balances added blockchain . Each user open digital wallet store Bitcoins deposit coins channel opened money kind security deposit behalf parties honor transaction Once exchange money books updated sign ledger channelFinally added blockchain channel closed The network globally scalable reach person connected channels network path connect person leveraging existing network . Once network develops future requirement open separate channel cease exist algorithm automatically find shortest route connect person pay based exhaustive peer peer network . This ease inter country transactions money internationally seconds . Limitations technology Since channel Lightning Network separate connected main Blockchain backed security original Blockchain . This major concern widespread adoption companies research extensively . Another challenge dependency internet . The Lightning Network capable storing coins digitally hardware wallet . This makes prone hackers wallet online . Also transferring large amounts money detailed research bigger payment struggle routing network . Nevertheless technology fascinating broad usage implementation Bitcoins Distributed Ledger everyday life . Once rolled customer experience micropayments parties Blockchain wallets transfer money small purchases . The Lightning Network long surely big disruption Fintech domain Blockchain .
