 Sometimes illness sits body waiting time bloom remarked . Bob consultant globe trotting days week finally toll health sat recuperating plush hospital room miles home New York . Gazing window suddenly remembered Jacob physician back home calling work days ago warning sufficient rest control stress levels heartbeat started showing irregularities . Jacob remotely monitoring Bob cardiac information cardiac arrest years ago guide Bob medication doses diet based real time data . Should realized Jacob crying wolf predicted wrong . Bob conference felt shooting pain hand knew cardiac arrest alert vision blurred fell ground . Ray conference rushed Bob reached wallet find Health Information Card carried Unique Patient Identity UPI details . Every counted Bob breathing slowed sirens blared ears Ray paramedics jump ambulance complete charts Bob previous medical records UPI Ray provided . As Ray climbed ambulance paramedics started preliminary round treatment based real time vital stats past medical history inputs cardiologist remotely monitoring situation hospital . Bob safe . This technology achieve empowering healthcare provider make efforts save lives backed powerful insights data . This story tale present . So huge volumes data generated step healthcare chain advances technology explore varied data stopping technology data driven healthcare today ? For industry data driven main element decision making guessed Data problem lies . For data driven approach making complex decisions imperative collect relevant high quality consistent reliable data utilized derive insights predict future outcomes high accuracy . Thus healthcare fully exploit data analytics develop strong capabilities integration data multiple sources capability build develop advanced analytical models lower error margins ability transform organization breeding ground deep insights predictive prognosis mindset inclined adopting transformation analytical models drive results . Data collection integration Finding data major challenge analytics project healthcare major reason low adoption rates digital data capturing methods high data fragmentation . Low adoption digital practices means healthcare providers rely manual modes data entry notes oral recommendations convey patient medical information . Despite technologically advanced countries Electronic Health Records EHR adoption rate end May . This dismal state analytics based limited information good representation actual population . In developing countries percentages disappointing low digitized data lesser interoperability . Electronic Medical Records EMR prevalent EHR means Bob visited health provider Jacob high chances medical records . Bob wears Fitbit tracks activity levels sleep pattern details.He MyFitnessPal app mobile check calorie intake.He regular social media user posts day platforms . With growth technologies remote monitoring wearables social media analytics . Bob patient generating lot real time data wearable devices apps . His social media interactions analyzed text analytics explore predict mental health issues . These considered major source data analytics . Clinical data EHR EMR monthly yearly credit card transactions make medical payments medical claim settlements genetic databases public records major sources data analytics.This makes data sources fragmented difficult work due dissimilar syntaxes . Fragmented database seldom leads standardized good quality data . Also organization goal achieve data collects nature data captured . Bob UPI made easy paramedics serve interest turnaround time . No UPI unique identifier patient makes difficult integrate patient data sources . Countries Australia Canada France New Zealand Norway Sweden U.K advanced EHR capabilities achieve adoption rate high interoperability employing UPIs . Organization mindset Jacob faced lot resistance nurses clinic announced introduction CPOE EHR machines entry data . The nurses earlier manually write patient information felt threatened machines jobs . Resistance adoption technology due job reduction impacts skill gap adopt technology leading higher costs training.With huge volumes data generated threat security standpoint addressed . Since healthcare entails lot sensitive information patient heightened risk thefts paramount identity theft . From number individuals affected protected health information breaches increased approximately . million approximately million US . Without data governance structure place patients fear shun providers implementing e entry data . Healthcare providers reluctant set standard data promote data interoperability standardization EMR data make easier patients switch health providers . Thus imposing barriers exit convenient retain patient base turn restricts possibilities analytics wide scale implementation . Advanced Analytics The IBM Watson debacle inaccurate cancer predictions raised important question machines trusted complex decisions ? In business cost failure life monetized lot stake . Analytical models trained make predictions higher recall training data quality data accurately defined past as is situationData ever changing variables regulatory environmental factors . change analytical model ways keeping data big challenge.Deep learning models prediction act black box clear understanding predicted outcome impacted input features . The program named Deep Patient trained large training dataset individuals . Without expert intervention discovered patterns data predicted people wide range ailments mental illnesses cancer breakthrough . However problem researchers arrive results complete model Blackbox . This increase risk wrong diagnosis certainty scenario model fail . The overcome challenges layout stronger data governance laws ensure government regulations providers create barriers exit patients incentivize healthcare providers adopt digital transformation strategies . The Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act HIPAA step direction protect Patient Health Information PHI mandates providers set compliant infrastructure threats security . However long fears health care providers patients electronic modes capturing data assuaged capabilities capturing relevant data giving much needed impetus analytics healthcare .
