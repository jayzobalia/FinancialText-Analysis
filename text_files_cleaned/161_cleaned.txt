Oil Gas industry impacted industries digital disruption . Traditionally industry requires high capital operating costs workforce work unsafe conditions . Further unpredicted nature oil rigs capacity rig huge capital invested makes attractive area potential emerging digital technologies . The industry changed barrels amount bytes . Potential Areas Digital Technology It helps improve areas Manufacturing operations marketing servicing functions imagine volumetric display Affective computing Data integration Digital manufacturing mixed reality machine learning LTE high performance computing personal analytics predictive analytics cognitive technologies deep learning Artificial intelligence robots . The safety working conditions improved . Oil Exploration Source Institute Petroleum Energy Vol . Across stages involved production oil gas industry digital technology implemented Exploration Currently standardized data advanced algorithms high performance computers put operation analyzing visualization states . By augmenting visual cognition geoscientists machine learning reveal geography size existing portfolio including identifying sub commercial marginal resources reducing profitability locking significant capital . This creates potential means increasing certainty extraction rigs deeper commercial viability P reserves form P reserves . Development At present distinct objective proprietary tools lack standardized data creating wide variety integration issues . By integrating analyzing securely layered integrated frameworks analytics diverse drilling data open source architecture capability saving costs billion dollars upstream players annually . This helps breaking data silos finding digital RoI pace direction innovation intact . Production The current standing continuity operations legacy asset base explains sensorized state operation . To break never ending cycle upgrading retrofitting equipment existing fields spending attained sensorizing layered data generation strategy extend analysis reservoir level . This results additional cash flow billion cost savings equipment failure repair . Till date capabilities digital technology explored developing roadmaps optimizing operating costs involved . However scope disruption digital technology untapped landscape productive capital PPE Plant Property Equipment The quality efficiency system dramatically increase employing IoT phases results illustrated Effects IoT Oil Gas Industry Cyber security Another important area benefits cybersecurity oil gas industry . This area vulnerable posing threat nation . The cyber attack lead seepage sensitive information prove costly lead plant shutdown . With increase involvement digital technology risk cyberterrorism evolved end industrial espionage disruption operations . Due increased risk reports ABI Research oil gas companies planning spend . billion protection cyber attack . But part rise risk due data based linkages operations dealt digital technology . The data information rigs refineries headquarters encrypted end end safety ensured . Thus approach deal issue cyber security oil gas sector programmatically sustainably .
